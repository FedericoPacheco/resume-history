### Summary 

Recently graduated Information Systems Engineer recognized for high academic performance with nearly 1 year of experience as a Fullstack Developer on an e-learning platform. Curious and disciplined, continuously studying testing, refactoring, design patterns, SOLID principles, software architecture and distributed systems fundamentals. Seeking a second developer role in a team that values code quality and strong engineering culture.

### Work Experience

**Junior Fullstack Developer — [Serfe SA](https://www.serfe.com/en)**  
*October 2024 – July 2025*  
Bluejacketeer project, a study platform based on flashcards/Q&A format designed for U.S. Navy personnel.  
 
 - Implemented key Audio Study features (playlist player, progress tracking, reporting, custom pronunciation) supporting 20,000 active users.
 - Championed backend testing, delivering a prototype (unit and integration tests + coverage reports + mutation testing) and subproject plan; wrote first 100 unit tests doing classic test-driven development (TDD) to raise code quality and reduce bugs.
 - Resolved critical concurrency issues that caused duplicated user subscriptions, reducing billing errors and support tickets.
 - Optimized frequently used endpoint through parallelization and caching, achieving 10x faster response times as measured by subsequent statistical analysis. 
 - Enhanced study material automatic generation with LLMs through focused prompt engineering, reducing writers' workload.
