### Summary

Recently graduated Information Systems Engineer recognized for high academic performance with nearly 1 year of experience as a Fullstack Developer on an e-learning platform. Curious and disciplined, continuously studying testing, refactoring, design patterns, SOLID principles, software architecture and distributed systems fundamentals. Seeking a second developer role in a team that values code quality and strong engineering culture.

### Work Experience

**Junior Fullstack Developer — [Serfe SA](https://www.serfe.com/en)**  
*October 2024 – July 2025*  
Bluejacketeer project, a study platform based on flashcards/Q&A format designed for U.S. Navy personnel.  

- Implemented key Audio Study features (playlist player, progress tracking, reporting, custom pronunciation) supporting 20,000 active users.
- Championed backend testing, delivering a prototype (unit and integration tests + coverage reports + mutation testing) and subproject plan; wrote first 100 unit tests doing classic test-driven development (TDD) to raise code quality and reduce bugs.
- Resolved critical concurrency issues that caused duplicated user subscriptions, reducing billing errors and support tickets.
- Optimized frequently used endpoint through parallelization and caching, achieving 10x faster response times as measured by subsequent statistical analysis.
- Enhanced study material automatic generation with LLMs through focused prompt engineering, reducing writers' workload.
- Stack: JavaScript, CSS, React, Redux, Redux-Saga, Node.js, Mocha, Sinon, Chai, Istanbul, Stryker, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Git.

**Research Scholar — National Technological University, Santa Fe Regional Faculty (UTN FRSF)**  
*April 2023 – December 2023*  
Topic: Application of machine learning algorithms, employed in the *Career's Final Project*.

### Personal Projects

**ToDo App — [todo.federicopacheco.dev](https://todo.federicopacheco.dev)**

- Implemented a comprehensive testing strategy (53 unit, 14 integration, 5 e2e tests + mutation testing) achieving >90% coverage, reducing defects on production.
- Built a complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions, automating linting, testing, builds, database backups, deployments to AWS Lightsail with Nginx reverse proxy, and rollbacks on health check failures, eliminating manual errors and reducing downtime to 1-2min per release.
- Secured the system with session-based authentication, password hashing, CSRF tokens, and HTTPS to protect against common OWASP web vulnerabilities.
- Documented key architecture decisions (ADRs + C4 diagrams) to enhance technical clarity and facilitate future maintenance.
- Stack: Bluejacketeer's stack, plus Husky and Playwright.

**Career's Final Project — [Software prototype for feature extraction from agreements using Machine Learning and NLP](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rxmj_EF8QLRGXrzvovQt6Eb_Ysypm1KeZ3z4BWp-x3I/edit?usp=sharing)**  

- Automated the processing of documents from the Department of Extension and Culture at UTN FRSF, reducing manual work and improving consistency.
- Designed and trained a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model, including preprocessing, dataset creation, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation, achieving accurate extraction of key terms.
- Developed a user-friendly graphical interface integrated with the ML model, enabling non-technical staff to process and analyze documents efficiently.
- Stack: Python, SpaCy, Tesseract, OpenCV.

**Final assignment for the Cloud applications development course.**

- Designed and implemented three independent microservices, each with its own database (two relational, one NoSQL), enabling scalable management of product orders for multiple clients.
- Integrated REST APIs and RabbitMQ messaging to ensure reliable inter-service communication.
- Developed unit and integration tests using Testcontainers, JUnit, and Mockito to verify core business logic.
- Applied cloud-native patterns such as API Gateway and Service Discovery (Eureka), and configured observability tools (Graylog, Prometheus, Grafana) to enhance monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities.
- Deployed the entire architecture locally using containers.
- Stack: Java, Spring, Maven, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, Eureka, Graylog, Prometheus, Grafana, RabbitMQ, Testcontainers, JUnit, Mockito.
